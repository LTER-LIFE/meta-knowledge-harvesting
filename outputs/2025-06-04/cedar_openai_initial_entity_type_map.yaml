  Description:
  - Camera trap pilot 2 was a test of the difference in species detection and data
    accumulation between a Snyper Commander camera with a regular lens (52°) and one
    with a wide lens (100°). The cameras were deployed at 30 cm above the ground within
    the herbivore exclosure Zeeveld Noord in the Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes from
    14th of August 2021 to 24th of September 2021. During this pilot, a solar panel
    failure caused the cameras to stop recording data from the 24th of August 2021
    to the 6th of September (14 days). During annotation, only days in which both
    cameras were operational were annotated. This led to a total of 1,113 images over
    28 days from the two cameras. A detailed description of the dataset can be found
    in a data paper published in the journal Data in Brief (Evans et al. 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2024.110544).;

  Description:
  - Camera trapping pilot 3 was a test of the effect of lens angle, as well as a test
    of the influence of camera height and being deployed outside herbivore exclosures
    (security, herbivore damage, more varied habitat types). At each of three locations
    (all in the area Westweg of the Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes), both a regular
    lens Snyper Commander camera (52°) and a wide lens Wilsus Tradenda camera (100°)
    were deployed (n = 6 cameras). The cameras were placed at different heights at
    each location (30 cm, 40 cm and 50 cm above the ground). A month of data from
    this pilot was annotated, from 1st March 2023 to 31st of March 2023. This led
    to a total of 16,020 annotated images over 31 days from six cameras. A detailed
    description of the dataset can be found in a data paper published in the journal
    Data in Brief (Evans et al. 2024, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2024.110544).;
