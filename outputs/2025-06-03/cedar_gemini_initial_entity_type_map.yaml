  Description:
  - 'eBird is a collective enterprise that takes a novel approach to citizen science

    population ecologists, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists, statisticians,
    computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application developers,
    and data administrators. Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBirds goal
    is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement globally,
    but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability,
    imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection.
    eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers,
    scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. The result
    is that eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge
    of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation
    of birds and their habitats.; eBird is a citizen science initiative managed by
    the Cornell Lab of Ornithology that collects and provides open biodiversity data
    on bird occurrences to increase knowledge of species distributions and support
    conservation efforts.'
