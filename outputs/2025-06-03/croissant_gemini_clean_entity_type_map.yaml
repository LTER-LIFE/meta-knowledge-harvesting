  - The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance
    data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat
    8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europe's Copernicus
    Sentinel-2A satellites. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless
    products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow
    masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle
    normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.
