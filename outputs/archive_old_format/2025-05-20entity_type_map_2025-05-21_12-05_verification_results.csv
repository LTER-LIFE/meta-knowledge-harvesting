https://stac.ecodatacube.eu/green_glad.landsat.ard2.seasconv.m.yearly/collection.json,14,or een goed beheer van gebieden zoals de Waddenzee is een consistent en eenduidig inzicht in de veranderingen van de diverse landschappelijke eenheden van groot belang. Eén van de manieren om veranderingen in ecosystemen en landschappen inzichtelijk te maken is met ecotopenkaarten. Ecotopen zijn ruimtelijk te begrenzen ecologische eenheden,Description,"waarvan de samenstelling en ontwikkeling worden bepaald door abiotische, biotische en antropogene condities ter plaatse. Een ecotoop is een herkenbare, min of meer homogene landschappelijke eenheid. (Bouma et al., 2005). Ecotopenkaarten worden afgeleid uit een aantal onderliggende kaarten van in hoofdzaak fysische factoren, die samen de kenmerken van een ecotoop bepalen. In Nederland wordt gebruik gemaakt van het door Rijkswaterstaat ontwikkelde RijksWateren-EcotopenStelsel (RWES) die voor de zoute wateren is uitgewerkt in het Zoute wateren EcotopenStelsel., The description of the metadata record provides an overview of the importance of consistent and clear understanding of the changes in various landscape units for good management of areas like the Wadden Sea.",0.0,
