These datasets were generated based on research conducted by Rashidi et al. in 2023 and published in the Land Journal. We employed the GLOBIO land allocation routine to downscale fractional land use data, originally at a 0.25 deg resolution (approximately 25 km), into discrete land use maps at 10 m and 100 m resolutions. This process utilized three distinct reference land cover maps: ESA WorldCover at 10 m resolution, ESA WorldCover upscaled to 100 m resolution, and CORINE land cover at 100 m resolution. During the downsizing process, we considered three SSP-RCP scenarios to model land use trends for both the present and the year 2050 on a national scale in Belgium. Key components of the model included regional land use demand, an assessment of grid cells suitability for various land use types, and a reference land cover map. It is important to note that the classification system used in the reference maps differs from that of LUH2. To ensure comparability for land use simulations, we conducted a reclassification process following the methodologies outlined by Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2012), Dong et al. (2018), and Liao et al.

One of the ways to make changes in ecosystems and landscapes visible is with ecotope maps. Ecotopes are “spatially delimited ecological units, the composition and development of which are determined by abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic conditions on site. An ecotope is a recognizable, more or less homogeneous landscape unit.” (Bouma et al., 2005). Ecotope maps are derived from a number of underlying maps of mainly physical factors, which together determine the characteristics of an ecotope. In the Netherlands, the RijksWateren-EcotopenStelsel (RWES) developed by Rijkswaterstaat is used, which has been elaborated for salt waters in the Zoute wateren EcotopenStelsel.",WMR - TMAP: Ecotopenkaart.

These datasets were generated based on research conducted by Rashidi et al. in 2023 and published in the Land Journal. We employed the GLOBIO land allocation routine to downscale fractional land use data, originally at a 0.25 deg resolution (approximately 25 km), into discrete land use maps at 10 m and 100 m resolutions. This process utilized three distinct reference land cover maps: ESA WorldCover at 10 m resolution, ESA WorldCover upscaled to 100 m resolution, and CORINE land cover at 100 m resolution. During the downsizing process, we considered three SSP-RCP scenarios to model land use trends for both the present and the year 2050 on a national scale in Belgium. Key components of the model included regional land use demand, an assessment of grid cells suitability for various land use types, and a reference land cover map. It is important to note that the classification system used in the reference maps differs from that of LUH2. To ensure comparability for land use simulations, we conducted a reclassification process following the methodologies outlined by Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2012), Dong et al. (2018), and Liao et al.
