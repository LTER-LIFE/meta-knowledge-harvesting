    text: For the proper management of areas such as the Wadden Sea, a consistent
      and unambiguous insight into the changes in the various landscape units is of
      great importance. One of the ways to make changes in ecosystems and landscapes
      visible is with ecotope maps. Ecotopes are “spatially delimited ecological units,
      the composition and development of which are determined by abiotic, biotic and
      anthropogenic conditions on site. An ecotope is a recognizable, more or less
      homogeneous landscape unit.” (Bouma et al., 2005). Ecotope maps are derived
      from a number of underlying maps of mainly physical factors, which together
      determine the characteristics of an ecotope. In the Netherlands, the RijksWateren-EcotopenStelsel
      (RWES) developed by Rijkswaterstaat is used, which has been elaborated for salt
      waters in the Zoute wateren EcotopenStelsel.

    text: The three Wadden provinces – North Holland, Friesland and Groningen – jointly
      present the Wadden Balance 2024. This periodic socio-economic monitor provides
      an up-to-date picture of the broad prosperity and economic activities in the
      Wadden area. The results show that the broad prosperity in the region differs
      between the Wadden Islands, port municipalities and coastal municipalities.
      The Wadden Balance focuses on 14 municipalities in the Wadden area with a total
      of more than 460,000 inhabitants. The monitor was drawn up by Het PON & Telos,
      commissioned by the Wadden provinces and in consultation with the Wadden municipalities
      and the Ministry of LVVN. The monitor uses reliable, regularly available data.
      Themes such as health, income, well-being, mobility and social cohesion are
      made clear and compared with national trends for the Wadden area.

    text: An ecotope is an ecomorphological, landscape mappable unit. The ecotope
      system is classified based on the criteria height, current velocity, wave height,
      drying period, geomorphology, salinity and sediment composition. With the ecotope
      classification, gradual transitions in these variables are converted into discrete,
      mappable units. Changes in ecologically relevant changes in current velocity
      etc. are thus clearly quantifiable and can be used for explorations, planning
      studies and evaluations of construction and management.

    text: 'The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface
      reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS
      Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europes Copernicus
      Sentinel-2A satellites. The combined measurement enables global observations
      of the land every 2-3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project
      uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include
      atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration
      and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral
      bandpass adjustment. The HLS project distributes data as two separate products:
      HLSL30 (Landsat 8/9) and HLSS30 (Sentinel-2 A/B). They both provide 30m Nadir
      Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), Adjusted Reflectance
      (NBAR).'

      Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance
      of Terra MODIS Bands 1 through 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as
      gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven 500 meter (m)
      reflectance bands are two quality layers and four observation bands. For each
      pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite
      period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When
      several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3
      (blue) value is used.

      science by developing cooperative partnerships among experts in a wide range
      of fields: population ecologists, conservation biologists, quantitative ecologists,
      statisticians, computer scientists, GIS and informatics specialists, application
      developers, and data administrators. Managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology
      eBird’s goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and
      engagement globally, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues
      such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial
      and temporal bias in data collection. eBird data are openly available and used
      by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies,
      land managers, and policy makers. The result is that eBird has become a major
      source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species
      distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their
      habitats.'

    text: Camera trapping pilot 3 was a test of the effect of lens angle, as well
      as a test of the influence of camera height and being deployed outside herbivore
      exclosures (security, herbivore damage, more varied habitat types). At each
      of three locations (all in the area Westweg of the Amsterdam Water Supply Dunes),
      both a regular lens Snyper Commander camera (52°) and a wide lens Wilsus Tradenda
      camera (100°) were deployed (n = 6 cameras). The cameras were placed at different
      heights at each location (30 cm, 40 cm and 50 cm above the ground). A month
      of data from this pilot was annotated, from 1st March 2023 to 31st of March
      2023. This led to a total of 16,020 annotated images over 31 days from six cameras.

    text: Three camera trap data packages (https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org/) of data collected
      as part of pilot studies carried out in the  Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen.
      The pilots were aimed at determining how different types of camera deployment
      (e.g. regular vs. wide lens, various heights, inside/outside exclosures) might
      influence species detections, and how to deploy autonomous wildlife monitoring
      networks. Two pilots were conducted in herbivore exclosures and mainly detected
      European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). The third
      pilot was conducted outside exclosures, with the European fallow deer (Dama
      dama) being most prevalent. Across all three pilots, a total of 47,597 images
      were annotated using the Agouti platform. All annotations were verified and
      quality-checked by a human expert. A total of 2,779 observations of 20 different
      species (including humans) were observed using 11 wildlife cameras during 2021–2023.
      The raw image files (excluding humans), image metadata, deployment metadata
      and observations from each pilot are shared using the Camtrap DP open standard
      and the extended data publishing capabilities of GBIF to increase the findability,
      accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of this data. The data are
      freely available and can be used for developing artificial intelligence (AI)
      algorithms that automatically detect and identify species from wildlife camera
      images.

    text: 'This dataset comprises high-resolution land use data downscaled from LUH2
      scenarios for Belgium at both 10 m and 100 m resolutions. These datasets were
      generated based on research conducted by Rashidi et al. in 2023 and published
      in the Land Journal. We employed the GLOBIO land allocation routine to downscale
      fractional land use data, originally at a 0.25 deg resolution (approximately
      25 km), into discrete land use maps at 10 m and 100 m resolutions. This process
      utilized three distinct reference land cover maps: ESA WorldCover at 10 m resolution,
      ESA WorldCover upscaled to 100 m resolution, and CORINE land cover at 100 m
      resolution. During the downsizing process, we considered three SSP-RCP scenarios
      to model land use trends for both the present and the year 2050 on a national
      scale in Belgium. Key components of the model included regional land use demand,
      an assessment of grid cells suitability for various land use types, and a reference
      land cover map. It is important to note that the classification system used
      in the reference maps differs from that of LUH2. To ensure comparability for
      land use simulations, we conducted a reclassification process following the
      methodologies outlined by Pérez-Hoyos et al. (2012), Dong et al. (2018), and
      Liao et al. (2020). This reclassification consolidated land use classes, except
      for water, into seven general categories: 1) urban, 2) cropland, 3) pasture,
      4) forestry, 5) secondary vegetation, 6) undefined, and 7) natural. The raw
      data consists of three folders corresponding to the three reference maps, each
      containing four TIFF files (.tif), one for each scenario type.'
